There are various sorting algorithms available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency, memory usage, and other factors.
Here is a list of some commonly used sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort: Repeatedly steps through the list,
compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Selection Sort: Divides the list into two parts: sorted and unsorted.
It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest)
element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking elements from
the unsorted part and moving them into their correct position in the sorted part.

Merge Sort: Divides the unsorted list into smaller sub lists, sorts those sub lists,
and then merges them back together to get the final sorted list.

Quick Sort: Divides the list into two smaller sub lists:
elements less than a chosen pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
It then recursively sorts these sub lists.

Heap Sort: Builds a binary heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element
from the heap, leading to a sorted array.

Radix Sort: Sorts integers by processing individual digits or groups of digits
It's often used with numbers in a fixed range.

Counting Sort: Sorts integers by counting the occurrences of each element and using
that information to determine its position in the sorted output.

Bucket Sort: Distributes elements into a finite number of buckets and
then sorts each bucket individually,
often using another sorting algorithm or recursion.

Tim Sort: An adaptive sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort,
designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data.

Each of these sorting algorithms has its own set of characteristics,
efficiency,and best-case/worst-case scenarios.
he choice of which sorting algorithm to use depends on the specific requirements of
the task at hand and the characteristics of the data being sorted.
