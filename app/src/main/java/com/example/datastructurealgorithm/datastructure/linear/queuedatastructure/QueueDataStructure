Queue Data Structure
A queue is a useful data structure in programming.
It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall,
where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.
Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item
that goes in first is the item that comes out first.
