Non linear data structures
Unlike linear data structures, elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence.
Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner
where one element will be connected to one or more elements.

Non-linear data structures are further divided into graph and tree based data structures.

1. Graph Data Structure
In graph data structure, each node is called vertex and each vertex
is connected to other vertices through edges.

2. Trees Data Structure
Similar to a graph, a tree is also a collection of vertices and edges. However,
in tree data structure, there can only be one edge between two vertices.

3. Matrix Data Structure
A matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in an order of rows and columns.
It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets.
