In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other.
Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.
However, when the complexity of the program increases,
the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.

1. Array Data Structure
In an array, elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory.
All the elements of an array are of the same type.
And, the type of elements that can be stored in the form of
arrays is determined by the programming language.

2. Stack Data Structure
In stack data structure, elements are stored in the LIFO principle.
That is, the last element stored in a stack will be removed first.
It works just like a pile of plates where the last plate kept on the pile will be removed first.

3. Queue Data Structure
Unlike stack, the queue data structure works in the FIFO principle where first element stored in the queue will be removed first.
It works just like a queue of people in the ticket counter where first person on the queue will get the ticket first.

4. Linked List Data Structure
In linked list data structure, data elements are connected through a series of nodes.
And, each node contains the data items and address to the next node.
